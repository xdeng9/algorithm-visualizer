Algorithm Visualizer is a tool for visualizing different algorithms. This app is built using JavaScript and React.

Currently supports:
- Dijkstra's Algorithm - an algorithm for finding the shortest path. I implemented it using a Priority Queue.


More features coming:
- A* Algorithm
- N Queen's
- Merge Sort & Quick Sort
