Algorithm Visualizer is a tool for visualizing different algorithms. This app is built using JavaScript and React.

Currently supports:
- Dijkstra's Algorithm - an algorithm for finding the shortest path. I implemented it using a Priority Queue.


More features coming:
- A* Algorithm - a more optimal path finding algorithms. Faster than Dijkstra's.
- N Queen's - a puzzle for placing N queens on a N x N board.
- Merge Sort - a sorting algorithm that uses the divide and conquer approach.
- Quick Sort - another divide and conquer sorting algorithm.
